## About

> In short: Insert invisible text into your PDF for better matching with automated filtering systems

Applicant Tracking Systems(ATS) are trying to parse your resume to get data for further analysis. Most popular format to apply the vacancy is PDF.
But when you finish writing your resume, it might turn out that ATS cannot properly extract the text, and your resume simply fails the filtering process.
This might happen for the following reasons:  
- You created a visually appealing, custom-designed resume, but unfortunately, issues with text layers occurred after conversion.  
- You decided to rasterize all text layers, making it impossible to extract text except by using OCR.  
- Other design choices that result in problems with text conversion.

To eliminate any issues with text recognition, you simply need to add text that will be correctly extracted. This is exactly what this small application is designed to do.

## âš’ How to
1. Install `ats_friendly_resume`
    - via pip
     
     ```bash
     pip install ats-friendly-resume
     ```
     > The actual executable name will be `ats_friendly_resume`
2. Prepare:
    - Your PDF to past text into it(`resume.pdf`, for this example)
    - Full text which you want to insert(`resume.txt`, for this example)
3. Run `ats_friendly_resume`(simplest example):
   ```bash
   ats_friendly_resume --input="/path/to/resume.pdf" --text-file="/path/to/resume.txt"
   ```
4. Thats all! Get your optimized resume and apply it!

> (in this case resume will be in the same folder as input, and name also like input but with timestamp prefix)

## ðŸš§ CLI Usage
